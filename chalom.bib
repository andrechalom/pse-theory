Abstract = {{There is a bewildering range of estimates for the number of arthropods
   on Earth. Several measures are based on extrapolation from species
   specialized to tropical rain forest, each using specific assumptions and
   justifications. These approaches have not provided any sound measure of
   uncertainty associated with richness estimates. We present two models
   that account for parameter uncertainty by replacing point estimates with
   probability distributions. The models predict medians of 3.7 million and
   2.5 million tropical arthropod species globally, with 90\% confidence
   intervals of {[}2.0, 7.4] million and {[}1.1, 5.4] million,
   respectively. Estimates of 30 million or greater are predicted to have
   <0.00001 probability. Sensitivity analyses identified uncertainty in the
   proportion of canopy arthropod species that are beetles as the most
   influential parameter, although uncertainties associated with three
   other parameters were also important. Using the median estimates
   suggests that in spite of 250 years of taxonomy and around 855,000
   species of arthropods already described, approximately 70\% await

Journal = {{Ecology}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{374-388}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We present a temporally and spatially explicit mechanistic model of tree
   seed dispersal by wind, incorporating full stochasticity based on
   natural variation. The model simulates the dispersal of each individual
   seed by integrating the temporal effects of climatic conditions on the
   rate of seed release, and the spatial effects of wind direction and
   horizontal and vertical velocities, the terminal velocity of seeds
   (i.e., the constant descent velocity in calm air), and the height of
   seed release, partitioned into tree height and the distribution of seeds
   with tree height. The model was tested for two Pinus halepensis stands
   within the Mediterranean region of Israel, in which seed dispersal has
   been extensively monitored by seed traps. The predicted dispersal curve
   verified expectations of a positively skewed leptokurtic distribution
   and of peak location at some distance from a point source and at zero
   distance from an area source. Long-distance dispersal events occurred
   with very low frequency, but given the large seed crop in P. halepensis,
   even a small fraction should result in a considerable number of seeds
   dispersed far from their source. The model reliably simulates the
   observed dispersal pattern in a spatial resolution of 1 m(2) (R(2)
   between 60\% and 90\%), as revealed from comparisons of the predicted
   and observed proportions of seed dispersed to seed traps. A sensitivity
   analysis using Latin hypercube sampling along with stepwise multiple
   rank regression showed that the effects of the horizontal and vertical
   wind velocities on the dispersal distance override those of the biotic
   factors. This suggests that the synchronization of seed release with
   favorable winds is the most effective plant-controlled mechanism to
   increase the distance of dispersal in wind-dispersed species such as P.
   halepensis.}},

abstract = "Geostatistical stochastic simulation is always combined with Monte Carlo method to quantify the uncertainty in spatial model simulations. However, due to the relatively long running time of spatially explicit forest models as a result of their complexity, it is always infeasible to generate hundreds or thousands of Monte Carlo simulations. Thus, it is of great importance to generate a relatively small set of conditional realizations capturing most of the spatial variability. In this study, we introduced an effective sampling method (Latin hypercube sampling) into a stochastic simulation algorithm (LU decomposition simulation). Latin hypercube sampling is first compared with a common sampling procedure (simple random sampling) in LU decomposition simulation. Then it is applied to the investigation of uncertainty in the simulation results of a spatially explicit forest model, LANDIS. Results showed that Latin hypercube sampling can capture more variability in the sample space than simple random sampling especially when the number of simulations is small. Application results showed that LANDIS simulation results at the landscape level (species percent area and their spatial pattern measured by an aggregation index) is not sensitive to the uncertainty in species age cohort information at the cell level produced by geostatistical stochastic simulation algorithms. This suggests that LANDIS can be used to predict the forest landscape change at broad spatial and temporal scales even if exhaustive species age cohort information at each cell is not available."

abstract = "In this paper, we propose and analyse a mathematical model for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), a cancer of the blood. We model the interaction between naive T cells, effector T cells, and CML cancer cells in the body, using a system of ordinary differential equations which gives rates of change of the three cell populations. One of the difficulties in modeling CML is the scarcity of experimental data which can be used to estimate parameters values. To compensate for the resulting uncertainties, we use Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) on large ranges of possible parameter values in our analysis. A major goal of this work is the determination of parameters which play a critical role in remission or clearance of the cancer in the model. Our analysis examines 12 parameters, and identifies two of these, the growth and death rates of CML, as critical to the outcome of the system. Our results indicate that the most promising research avenues for treatments of CML should be those that affect these two significant parameters (CML growth and death rates), while altering the other parameters should have little effect on the outcome."

abstract = "We describe an individual-based spatially-explicit model designed to investigate the dynamics of badger populations and TB epidemiology in a real landscape. We develop a methodology for evaluating the sensitivity of the model to its input parameters through the use of power analysis, partial correlation coefficients and binary logistic regression. This novel approach to sensitivity analysis provides a formal statement of confidence in our findings based on statistical power, and a solution for analysing sparse data sets of disease prevalence. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the simulated badger population size after 20 years was most dependent on five parameters affecting female recruitment (probability of breeding, mortality of adult females in the first half of the year, mortality of juvenile females in the second half of the year and mortality of female cubs in the both halves of the year). The simulated prevalence of TB was most affected by the population size, the rate at which infectious badgers transmit the disease to other members of their social group, and the rate at which the disease is spread outside of the social group.

The spatial and temporal predictions of the model were tested against badger demography and TB prevalence data derived from the field. When validated in space, the model generated population sizes and disease incidence that were consistent with the observed field population. We conclude that modelling TB dynamics must include spatial and temporal heterogeneity in life history parameters, social behaviour and the landscape.

Based on parameter sensitivity and data availability, we suggest priorities for future empirical research on badgers and bovine tuberculosis."

Title = {Food dispersion and foraging energetics: A mechanistic synthesis for
   field studies of avian benthivores},
Journal = {Ecology},
Year = {{1996}},

Abstract = {{Much effort has focused on modeling and measuring the energy costs of
   free existence and the foraging strategies of animals. However, few
   studies have quantitatively linked these approaches to the patch
   structure of foods in the field. We developed an individual-based model
   that relates field measurements of the dispersion of benthic foods to
   search costs and foraging profitability of diving ducks.
   On Lake Mattamuskeet, North Carolina, Canvasback ducks (Aythya
   valisineria) eat only the belowground winter buds of the submerged plant
   Vallisneria americana. We measured and modeled the patch structure of
   winter buds at the level of potential foraging `'loci,'' defined as
   contiguous circles 1 m in diameter. In the field and in the model,
   Canvasbacks make repeated vertical dives in such loci, foraging in the
   sediments by touch, before surface-swimming to another locus. We
   quantified first-order patchiness by fitting a negative bi nomial
   distribution to core samples taken at 50-m intervals along transects, to
   yield the frequencies of loci with different bud densities. Second-order
   patchiness was measured by taking cores at 1-m increments radiating from
   each sampling point, and regressing bud density at each sampling point
   on densities at these increments. No significant correlations were
   found, indicating that Canvasbacks could not predict food densities
   based on densities in nearby foraging loci. For the model, we generated
   food grids from the negative binomial distributions of core samples.
   Energy costs of diving were calculated by applying aerobic efficiencies
   (mechanical power output divided by aerobic power input) to
   biomechanical models. Unlike respirometry alone, this method accounts
   for effects on dive costs of varying water depth and dive duration. We
   used measurements of Canvasback intake rates at different bud densities
   to calculate profitability (energy intake minus expenditure) for each
   dive. Multivariate uncertainty analyses (Latin hypercube) indicated that
   profitability for Canvasbacks foraging on Vallisneria buds is determined
   mainly by food-item size and locomotor costs of descent. Bud
   metabolizable energy, water temperature, bud dispersion, and search and
   handling time coefficients of the functional response for intake rate
   have relatively minor influence. Individual-parameter perturbations
   indicated that to maintain the same foraging benefits, the total area of
   Vallisneria habitat would have to increase by 1.4-fold if dry mass per
   bud decreased from 0.10 to 0.03 g, and by 2.1-fold if water depth
   increased from 0.5 to 2 m.
   Our method allows study of interactions between patch structure and
   foraging energetics without detailed spatial mapping of foods, which is
   not feasible at appropriate scales for highly mobile benthivores. The
   model yields estimates of energy balance, contaminant intake, and amount
   and quality of foraging habitat required to sustain diving duck
   populations under varying environmental conditions. More accurate
   prediction of giving-up times and giving-up food densities will require
   better understanding of the time scale over which ducks balance their
   energy budgets.}},
