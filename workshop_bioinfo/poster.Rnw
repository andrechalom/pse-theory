    \begin{block}{\large Abstract}
		The use of computer models in science is increasing, specially in fields where laboratory
		experiments are too complex or to costly, like ecology.

		Questions of efficient, systematic and error-proof exploration of parameter spaces are
		are of great importance to better understand, estimate confidences and make use of the 
		output from these models. 
		
		Common questions can be answered by qualitative analyses, traditional quantitative analyses
		and bayesian approaches.

		The {\em pse} package aims to implement these analyses in a unified and easy to use framework.

		Package {\em pse} is available for download at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pse/
		both in binary mode and source code.
		
		\R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. Packages for \R are built
		by a large user base and made available for use on the Comprehensive \R Archive Network (CRAN).

		Free software environments provide a sound foundation to write scientific code, as it permits
		reproductibilty, independent validation, colaborative writing and accesible learning.

        \begin{block}{Sampling}
          \begin{itemize}
			  \item Analytical results for sensitivity and uncertainty analyses are available for a small class
				  of ecological models \cite{Caswell10}.
			  \item	Sampling-based analyses are generally required. 
			  \item Traditional analyses are usually done by sampling from a Latin Hypercube.
			  \item	Most theoretical results and computer tools focus on deterministic models;
				  US analyses of stochastic models is an open and fresh area of study \cite{Marino08}.
			\item {\em pse} generates hypercubes with prescribed correlation terms between input
			  variables \cite{Huntington98}.
		  \item Symmetrized Blest Measure of Association (SBMA) \cite{Genest03} used for 
			  determining optimal sample size.
			  \item The methodology chosen facilitates parallelization.
          \end{itemize}

        \begin{block}{Analyses}
          \begin{itemize}
			  \item Qualitative analyses are carried by Bifurcation Analyse \cite{Tung10}.
			  \item Traditional quantitative analyses focus on partial rank correlation coefficients
				  and Sobol' indices \cite{Marino08}.
			  \item Bayesian analyses focus on GLUE and DREAM methods \cite{Vrugt09}.
			  \item {\em pse} currently implements traditional quantitative methods. Support for bayesian
				  methods is being developed.

		\begin{itemize}
		\item Support for multiple factors, multiple model responses and multiple model runs at the same point
		\item Support for uncoupling model simulation and statistical analyses.

		\caption{The current solution for scalabity consists in uncoupling the model simulation and
		statistical analyses. While the simulations are run on a high-performance cluster, the 
		analyses may be carried out on a regular computer.
		
		Future bayesian analyses will benefit from easily configurable clustering.}
