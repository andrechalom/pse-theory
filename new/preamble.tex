``In an ideal world, all data would come from well-designed experiments
and would be sufficient to simultaneously estimate all parameters using rigorous
statistical procedures. The world is not ideal. One must often combine estimates
from different experiments, or supplement high-quality data (...) with uncertain
data, or even assumptions (...). Think carefully about whether your conclusions
may be artifacts of your assumptions or calculations, and document those assumptions
and calculations so that your reader can ask the same question, and then carry on.''

(Hal Caswell, Matrix Population Models)
